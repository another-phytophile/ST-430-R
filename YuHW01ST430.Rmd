# Question 1

>1. A regression analysis relating test scores (Y) to training hours (X)  produced the following fitted equation: 𝑦̂ = 25 − 0.5𝑥.


>a. What is the fitted value of the response variable corresponding to  x = 7?

  25 - 0.5(7) = **3.5**
  
> b. What is the residual corresponding to the data point with x = 3 and  y = 30? Is the point above or below the line? Why?

  30-[25-(0.5*3)]= 6.5. The point is above the regression line because 30 > 23.5. 
  
> c. If x increases 3 units, how does 𝑦̂ change?

  ŷ decreases by 1.5.
  
d. An additional test score is to be obtained for a new observation at 
x = 6. Would the test score for the new observation necessarily be 22? 
Explain.
e. The error sums of squares (SSE) for this model was found to be 7. If 
there were n = 16 observations, provide the best estimate for 𝜎

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
